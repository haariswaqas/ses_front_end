PROJECT REPORT
FRONT-END REACT APP FOR SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES – UG

INTRODUCTION
The School of Engineering Sciences website is a comprehensive platform designed to provide information and services to students, faculty, and visitors. This project report outlines the development and features of the website, including its main components, functionality, and design.

OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the School of Engineering Sciences website are as follows:
•	Provide an engaging and user-friendly interface for accessing information about the school, programs, faculty, and resources.
•	Allow prospective students to explore the various engineering fields and programs offered by the school.
•	Facilitate student registration and provide a platform for accessing personal profiles.
•	Enable students to log in to their accounts, access their dashboards, and view personalized information.
•	Showcase the achievements, research, and projects of the school and its faculty members.
•	Serve as a communication tool for announcements, events, and news updates.


TECHNOLOGIES USED TO BUILD THE PROJECT
The website is developed using the following technologies:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Router: A library for routing and navigation within a React application.React Helmet: A component for managing the document head (e.g., adding meta tags, stylesheets).
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive web design.
HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
JavaScript: Used for interactivity and dynamic content.
COMPONENTS AND FUNCTIONALITY
Navigation Bar

Dashboard 
The dashboard provides a personalized view for logged-in students. It can display information such as course schedules, grades, announcements, and resources specific to each student. The dashboard serves as a central hub for students to access important information related to their academic journey.
 


DESIGN AND USER EXPERIENCE
The School of Engineering Sciences website is designed with a clean and intuitive layout to enhance user experience. The use of Bootstrap ensures responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. The website incorporates relevant images, typography, and color schemes to create an engaging and visually appealing interface.

CONCLUSION
The development of the School of Engineering Sciences website has successfully achieved its objectives of providing an informative, user-friendly, and interactive platform for students, faculty, and visitors. The website's components, functionality, and design work together to deliver a seamless experience and facilitate communication and access to resources within the school.
Future enhancements may include additional features such as an events calendar, a faculty directory, interactive course materials, and discussion forums. Regular updates and maintenance will be necessary to ensure the website remains up-to-date and meets the evolving needs of its users.
Overall, the School of Engineering Sciences website serves as an effective tool for promoting the school, engaging with students, and showcasing the accomplishments and offerings of the engineering programs.
